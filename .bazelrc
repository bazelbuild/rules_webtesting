# Do not build runfile forests by default. If an execution strategy relies on runfile
# forests, the forest is created on-demand. See: https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/6627
# and https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/commit/03246077f948f2790a83520e7dccc2625650e6df
# Note: This also works around an issue where Bazel does not support spaces in runfiles. The
# Chromium app files for Darwin contain files with spaces and this would break. For darwin though,
# the sandbox strategy is used anyway and runfile forests are not needed.
# Related Bazel bug: https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/4327.
